# What Kai Thinks Every Developer Should Know About The Shell

This is a [quick guide](shell_guide.md) to the unix shell for people totally new to it.

It is a work in progress (as all things are). Specifically it's a work done during stolen hours in the last couple weeks while working and going to Epicodus full time. If you have ideas for improvement, please feel free to submit a pull request.
For any inaccuracies, please file an issue.

If anyone can help with improving the presentation of this content, please email me. After a few hours each spent fighting with jekyll and pandoc, I'm probably leaning towards using Haroopad to spit out some appropriately styled HTML. It's been suggested to break this into multiple pages. I'm not sure when I might have time.
