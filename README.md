# What Kai Thinks Every Developer Should Know About The Shell
version 1.0.3

Â©2017 Patrick 'Kai' Leahy. Licensed CC0, but attribution would be polite.

This is a [quick guide](https://tenebrousedge.github.io/shell_guide/) to the unix shell for people totally new to it.

It is a work in progress (as all things are). If you have ideas for improvement, please feel free to submit a pull request.
For any inaccuracies, please file an issue.

I think that I've been winning my fights with jekyll, gh-pages, and CSS, but it's been a bit of a rough show and any contributions to the visual style would be appreciated.
